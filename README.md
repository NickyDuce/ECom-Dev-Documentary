# ECom-Dev-Documentary
Inquisition to E-commerce Development, from the front-end to the back.

<h1> Welcome to my documentary of E-commerce plateforms </h1>
_Here, I am the David attenborough and you are my eager enthusiastic spectators._


The purpose of this documentary is to explore what makes one E-commerce platform unique and distinct from another. Is it the amazing user Interactions, flashy colour pallets, the minimalistic themes or is it something more technical like the tech stack used, the api's utilized, the processing speed, the quality of code, the libraries utilized and the database implemented?
In addition, we will be analysing some amazing features within the renowned frameworks, disecting what makes them worthy of use and even utilizing their magic to build some amazing projects. 

Follow along in this journey and dont be shy to provide your own oppinion, "_all i really know is that I know nothing."
